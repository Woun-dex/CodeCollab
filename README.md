## ✨ Features

* **Real-time Code Editing:** Experience truly synchronized coding with operational transformation (OT) or conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT) under the hood (mention which if applicable, or just emphasize the real-time aspect). See every keystroke instantly.
* **Instant Messaging:** A dedicated, integrated chat system keeps communication flowing alongside your code.
* **Version History:** Never lose a change. Easily review and revert to previous states of your code.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Syntax highlighting and basic editing support for a wide range of popular programming languages.
* **Live Code Execution:** Run snippets or full programs directly within the editor environment. (*🧪 Coming Soon!* - *Consider specifying which languages initially*)
* **Access Control:** Secure your sessions with invite-only rooms and granular permission settings.
* **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean, responsive, and user-friendly design built for productivity.

## 🛠️ Built With

This project leverages a robust and modern tech stack to deliver a seamless real-time experience:

* **Frontend:**
    * [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    * [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React framework for production-ready applications (server-side rendering, static site generation, etc.).
    * [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
    * [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) or [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) - (Specify which code editor library you are using)
* **Backend:**
    * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
    * [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - A fast, minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
* **Real-Time Engine:**
    * WebSockets ([Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)) - Enables low-latency, bidirectional communication between the client and server.
* **Database:**
    * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - A NoSQL document database for flexible data storage.
* **Authentication:**
    * JWT (JSON Web Tokens) - For secure authentication and information exchange.
    * OAuth (*optional for future*) - For third-party login integrations.
* **DevOps & Deployment:**
    * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Containerization for consistent environments.
    * [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) (*deployment-ready*) - Automation for application deployment and configuration.
